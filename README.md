# Memory Management

A repository that can serves as a guide to understanding memory management in JavaScript / Node.jsâ€”from garbage collection fundamentals to advanced debugging techniques. Whether you're battling memory leaks, optimizing V8 engine performance, or mastering WeakMap and WeakRef, these practical examples will help you write faster, leaner, and more reliable code.

## Why This Repo?

Memory issues in JavaScript / Node.js can be silent killers, draining performance, crashing servers, and causing unpredictable behavior.

## Setup Guide
- clone the repo
- `npm install`
- go to each directory and `node --inspect <filename>.js`

## Memory Leak Summary

### 1. **setInterval Never Cleared**

#### Problem
- `setInterval()` retains a closure that holds a large object ( Array, Buffer, etc)
- Never calling `clearInterval()` -> memory grows over time

#### Symptoms
- Repeating timers that never stop
- Retained closures in heap snapshots
- Increasing retained heap size per interval

#### Fix
- Use `clearInterval()` affter a timeout or condition
- Or use `setTimeout()` if no repeating is needed

```node
const interval = setInterval(() => {
  // logic
}, 1000);

setTimeout(() => clearInterval(interval), 10000);
```

### 2. EventEmitter Listeners Never Removed

#### Problem
- Adding listeners (emitter.on) but never removing them
- Each listener closure holds onto user-specific data
- Causes memory growth and may trigger `MaxListenersExceededWarning`

#### Symptoms
- Increasing number of closures
- Retained memory in `EventEmitter._events`
- Listeners reference large objects via closure

#### Fix
- Always remove listeners using `removeListeners()` or `off()`
- Or use `once() ` for one-time events

```node
const onMessage = (msg) => { ... };
emitter.on('event', onMessage);

// Cleanup
emitter.removeListener('event', onMessage);
```
